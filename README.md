# AdRoast
## An advertisement critiquing application specifically targeted to small businesses for advertisment improvement. 

### Inspiration:
Usually, large businesses have developed and sophisticated marketing departments and are able to gather large quntities of data around their consumer base. This, however, is not possible for small businesses (less than 50 employees). This Android application allows the user to indicate their buisness and sector, then upload or capture their advertisements for inspection. The app will then send the image to the python backend which will essentially 'critique' the advertisements and provide potential pointers on what can improved. These results will then be displayed to the user so they can improve their advertising before pubication.
